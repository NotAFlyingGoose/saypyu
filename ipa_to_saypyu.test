### Tests for IPA to SaypYu conversion ###
#
# Examples from SaypYu related websites were taken and used
# here for tests to ensure that the converter is working properly.
#
# Note that some of the SaypYu given in websites is contradictory,
# and so these have been edited in order to be as logical and consistent as possible.
# In these cases, the original SaypYu has been kept in parentheses.
#
# The format of a test is
# "<english> <ipa> <saypyu> (<original saypyu>)"
# there can be multiple "<ipa> <saypyu>" pairs per english word and
# the last part is optional.
#
# The first site also has some slight very beneficial reforms to SaypYu.
# You can read about these here:
